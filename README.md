# How to use these files

In order to run the python scripts, it's necessary to have MPCTools available here: https://bitbucket.org/rawlings-group/mpc-tools-casadi/src/master/

A) In bare_sim, you will find these files:
  1) basic_sim.py - this will run a single MPC simulation and animate the results over a double gyre vector field *use this to get started and for sanity checks*
  2) sim_ftle.py - this will run an MPC simulation and animate results over an FTLE field. *Note: you must first create an FTLE data file using     ftle_calc.py before being able to plot over an FTLE field. This needs to be done once*
  3) ftle_calc.py - creates a .npz file of FTLE field data
  4) mpc_hist_lzy.py - this was used to generate the histogram plots (heading angle, x/y components, energy spent) in our paper

B) In rq_sweeps, you will find: (This was used to generate the appendix figures and Figure 2 in our paper)
  1) mpc_bundle_rq.py - This runs multiple simulations (default 100) and plots the full trajectories for each simulation as the cost function values change in an animation. There also exists an option to save data for later reading. 
  2) read_slide_rq.py - If data was saved, this python file can be used to re-read and visualize the results

C) In multi_sweep, you will find: (Figure 8 was generated using the files here)
  1) double_sweep.py - Generates data by running 100 simulations (default, can be changed) over different time horizons (default, can be changed) and saves it to a .npz file
  2) read_d_sweep.py - This python script can be used to visualize the .npz file generated by double_sweep.py
