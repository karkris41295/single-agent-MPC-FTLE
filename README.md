# How to use these files

In order to run the python scripts, it's necessary to have MPCTools available here: https://bitbucket.org/rawlings-group/mpc-tools-casadi/src/master/

In bare_sim, you will find two files:
1) basic_sim.py - this will run a single MPC simulation and animate the results over a double gyre vector field
2) mpc_hist_lzy.py - this was used to generate the histogram plots (heading angle, x/y components, energy spent) in our paper
